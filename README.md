Plaits is a form creation & validation library for Node.js / Express.

It supports synchronous and Promise based request parsing and validation.

Built-in validation is backended by the excellent [validator.js library][validator-js].

Custom validation is also provided which can be both synchronous and asynchronous, with examples also found below.

Plaits is inspired by the form validation features found in frameworks such as [.NET MVC][dot-net-mvc],
and thanks goes to the great work done on the [Bookshelf ORM][bookshelf-orm] for additional inspiration and helping with some underlying code principles.
